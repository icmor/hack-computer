# Hack Computer
Hardware projects for the excellent [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

## Tools
The tools folder contains the [Nand2Tetris Software Suite](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software). The linked website hosts pdf tutorials on every tool and a Google Drive download link. The following programs from the suite are required for testing:

- Hardware Simulator: simulate and test HDL files.
- CPUEmulator: execute Hack assembly on a simulated CPU.

Every tool in the Nand2Tetris suite is accesible via shell scripts in the tools folder that accept an appropriate *.tst file or open up a GUI when run without arguments.
